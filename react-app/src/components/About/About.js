          Iâ€™m a passionate software developer with the innovative and creative mindset of an entrepreneur. I have experience building dynamic web applications with React, Javascript, Express, Python, Redux, Flask, Docker, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, and CSS.
          I love the battle of developing an idea into existence and forging the bridge between conceptualization and a tangible, impactful product.
          Programming has been my outlet for problem-solving and creative expression.

          <p>
          Apart from coding, I enjoy playing golf, boxing, spending time with my dog and my family.
          My background in Business and Account Management has given me a unique perspective on the importance of a strong brand and the value of a great user experience.
          I'm able to combine my passion for programming with my business background to create a product that is both functional and beautiful.

          My inspiration behind creating this app was to motivate people to get out and exercise. I wanted to create a platform that would allow people to create their own workout plans.
          I understand how overwhelming and intididating it can be to start working out, which is why I aggregated hundreds of workouts orgranized by muscle groups so you can go and Get After It.
          Using this app is as simple as creating a workout plan, choosing a muscle group, and adding workouts you want to a plan of your choice. You can follow along with the gifs to make sure you're doing the exercises correctly.
